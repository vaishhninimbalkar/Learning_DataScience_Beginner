#### **Detailed Explanation:**
Python provides various data structures to store and manipulate data efficiently. Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets have different use cases and functionalities.

#### **Exercises:**
1. Create a list and add five elements to it.
2. Convert a list into a tuple.
3. Write a program to count the number of occurrences of each word in a sentence using a dictionary.
4. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data structures.
5. Implement a set operation to find common elements between two sets.
6. Use list comprehension to create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.
7. Retrieve a value from a dictionary using a key.
8. Add and remove elements from a set.
9. Sort a list in ascending order.
10. Explain why dictionaries are useful in data science.

### **Day 4: NumPy for Data Science**
#### **Topics Covered:**
- Arrays vs Lists
- NumPy Arrays and Operations

#### **Detailed Explanation:**
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on them.

#### **Exercises:**
1. Install NumPy and import it into a Python script.
2. Create a NumPy array and print its shape.
3. Perform element-wise addition of two NumPy arrays.
4. Use slicing to extract specific elements from an array.
5. Reshape a 1D array into a 2D array.
6. Find the mean and standard deviation of an array.
7. Perform matrix multiplication using NumPy.
8. Convert a list into a NumPy array.
9. Generate a random array of size 5x5.
10. Explain the advantages of NumPy over Python lists.

### **Day 5: Pandas for Data Manipulation**
