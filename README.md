## Final Test: Sample Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?  
   **A**: Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models (classification, regression), while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data for tasks like clustering or dimensionality reduction.

2. **Q**: Explain the bias-variance trade-off in machine learning.  
   **A**: Bias refers to assumptions that can lead to underfitting, while variance refers to sensitivity to small changes in the training set. A balance between low bias and low variance must be found.

3. **Q**: Name two ways of handling missing data and one drawback of each.  
   **A**:
   - Dropping rows/columns: can cause loss of valuable information.
   - Imputation (mean/median): may distort the true data distribution.

4. **Q**: What is a Type I error vs. a Type II error in hypothesis testing?  
   **A**: Type I error (False Positive) occurs when the null hypothesis is true but rejected. Type II error (False Negative) occurs when the null hypothesis is false but not rejected.

5. **Q**: Describe regularization and why it is important.  
   **A**: Regularization (e.g., L1/L2) adds a penalty to model complexity, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

6. **Q**: When would you use F1-score over accuracy?  
   **A**: When dealing with imbalanced data, because F1-score combines precision and recall, highlighting performance on minority classes better than accuracy.

7. **Q**: What is the difference between bagging and boosting?  
   **A**:
   - Bagging trains multiple models in parallel on bootstrapped datasets and averages predictions.
   - Boosting trains models sequentially, each focusing on the errors of the previous model.

8. **Q**: Why are CNNs particularly effective for image processing tasks?  
   **A**: CNNs use convolutional filters to capture local spatial patterns, reducing the number of parameters and effectively learning hierarchical features.

9. **Q**: Why is model monitoring important after deployment?  
   **A**: Data distributions can shift over time (concept drift), causing performance degradation. Monitoring ensures continued model accuracy and reliability.

10. **Q**: What is a key advantage of using Spark for big data processing?  
    **A**: Spark performs in-memory computations, leading to faster processing of large datasets and more efficient iterative tasks compared to disk-based systems.
